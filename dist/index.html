        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>
          On October 3, 1990, Gerald Reed, 27, was arrested and questioned
          regarding the murder two days earlier of Willie Williams and Pamela
          Powers. He was questioned by Detectives Michael Kill and Victor Breska
          at Area 3 Homicide, members of the notorious “Midnight Crew” of
          torturer Jon Burge. They beat him and kicked him repeatedly, and broke
          a metal rod that was in his right thigh along with the surgical screws
          that held it in place, causing him excruciating pain. The rod had been
          surgically placed years before to repair his thigh-bone, which had
          been shattered by a gunshot.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear to Reed that the beatings would continue until he agreed
          to confess, and he did. He repudiated the confession at his trial and
          has proclaimed his innocence ever since. There was no other material
          evidence against Reed at his trial. Gerald Reed was convicted of both
          murders, and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of
          parole.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that did not stop the torture. For 27 years Reed has repeatedly
          requested medical intervention to fix the horrible and excruciatingly
          painful damage done by his torturers. He has been unable to walk.
          Finally, last year, he was taken from Stateville Correctional Center
          to Dreyer Medical Center in Aurora, where Orthopedic Surgeon Steven I.
          Rabin performed the first step required to repair the terrible damage
          to his thigh-bone and ease his suffering. Dr. Rabin made it clear that
          a second, follow-up surgery, was necessary to improve his condition
          and end his pain, along with physical therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gerald Reed was returned to the hospital at Stateville in January
          where he waited for the second surgery. Dr. Rabin, however, had a
          heart attack and was unable to complete the task. Gerald Reed has been
          in the hospital at Stateville ever since, for over ten months. He has
          had minimal physical therapy, and is still suffering from serious pain
          in his leg.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Illinois Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission held, in a decision
          rendered on June 18, 2012 and further amended on March 19, 2014, that
          there was a “preponderance of evidence” that Reed had been tortured
          and forced to confess. Yet more than 5 years later Gerald Reed remains
          in prison and in terrible pain as a result of being tortured by
          Chicago Police.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression calls on
          all people to join with Gerald Reed’s large family and community of
          friends and supporters to demand:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Doctors designated by Gerald Reed’s immediate family must be allowed
            to examine him.
          </li>
          <li>
            Governor JB Pritzker should immediately and unconditionally pardon
            Gerald Reed and release him from prison.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gerald Reed must immediately be transferred from the prison hospital
            at Stateville Correctional Center to a hospital specializing in
            orthopedic surgery, where the correction of his shattered right
            thigh can be completed, and an appropriate prescription for physical
            therapy can be implemented.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx must drop all charges against
            Gerald Reed and move to secure from the court a certificate of his
            innocence.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Judge Thomas J. Hennelly has attempted to illegally reverse the order
          of another judge, Thomas V. Gainer, who vacated the conviction of
          Gerald Reed and ordered a new trial. Gainer vacated Reed’s conviction
          after overwhelming evidence that his “confession” to a double murder
          in 1990 was the fruit of horrible torture by police working under
          Commander Jon Burge, torture so extreme that it broke his thigh bone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one hundred people packed into Hennelly’s courtroom Friday
          February 14, 2020 were stunned when Hennelly announced his decision to
          send Reed back to Prison to serve a life term. They left seething with
          anger, and in tears. Armanda Shackelford, Reed’s mother and a leader
          of the Chicago Alliance, responded in disbelief. “I never would have
          thought that this judge would do what he did today,” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Circuit Court judge has no authority to reverse the decision of
          another circuit court judge. Significantly, Hennelly’s boss as a
          prosecutor was once none other than Robert Milan, the special
          prosecutor appointed to Reed’s case. Horrible Hennelly is not only
          abusing his power, he's doing so to protect the corrupt lawyers who
          enable police torture. Enough is enough!
